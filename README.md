# KKutzSite
Final  project for CS 213 Web Engineering I

Notes: 
For this class, we were not allowed to use libraries or frameworks. 
We were allowed to use images from other sites, since it was for educational purposes, and the requirement was to demonstrate the ability to use an image not create one.
